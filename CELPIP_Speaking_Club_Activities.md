## Workshop Outline

### Opening (10 minutes)
**Ice Breaker Activity:** "Speaking Goals Circle"

- Instructor maps challenges to the 4 CELPIP criteria on whiteboard

### Part 1: Criteria Overview (15 minutes)

#### Interactive Introduction: "The CELPIP Speaking Recipe"
Present the 4 criteria as ingredients in a recipe:

ðŸ§  **Content/Coherence** = The main dish (your ideas)
ðŸ“š **Vocabulary** = The spices (word choice) 
ðŸ‘‚ **Listenability** = The presentation (how it sounds)
âœ… **Task Fulfillment** = Following the recipe (meeting requirements)

**Group Discussion:** "Which ingredient do you struggle with most?"

---

## Part 2: Criterion Deep-Dive Activities (50 minutes)

### Activity 1: Content/Coherence Detective (12 minutes)

**Setup:** Students receive 3 response transcripts (CLB 4, 6, 9) for the same task
**Task:** Rank them from weakest to strongest and explain why

**Sample Task:** "Your friend is considering studying abroad. Give advice."

**CLB 4 Response:**
"Study abroad good idea. Learn English better. Meet new people. But expensive. Family far away. You decide."

**CLB 6 Response:**
"Studying abroad has both advantages and disadvantages. You'll improve your English significantly and gain international experience. However, you need to consider the financial cost and being away from family. I recommend researching scholarship opportunities first."

**CLB 9 Response:**
"This is an excellent opportunity for personal and academic growth. While studying abroad requires substantial financial investment and emotional adjustment, the long-term benefits often outweigh the challenges. I'd suggest creating a detailed budget, researching cultural adaptation resources, and establishing a communication plan with family before making your final decision."

**Debrief:** Discuss what makes ideas "well-developed" vs. "basic"

### Activity 2: Vocabulary Upgrade Challenge (12 minutes)

**Round 1: Basic to Better**
Students work in pairs to "upgrade" basic sentences:

Basic: "The house is big and nice."
Upgraded: "The property is spacious and charming."

Basic: "I like this job because it's good."
Upgraded: "I'm drawn to this position because it offers excellent growth opportunities."

**Round 2: Context Match**
Give students formal vs. informal contexts and have them choose appropriate vocabulary:

*Context: Calling a friend about furniture*
- Formal: "I encountered an aesthetically pleasing ergonomic seating solution."
- Appropriate: "I found this really cool chair that looks super comfortable."

**Round 3: Precision Practice**
Replace vague words with specific ones:
- "thing" â†’ specify what thing
- "nice" â†’ beautiful/effective/comfortable
- "bad" â†’ challenging/disappointing/problematic

### Activity 3: Listenability Clinic (13 minutes)

**Part A: Grammar Patterns (5 minutes)**
Students practice transforming simple sentences to complex ones:

Simple: "I went to the store. I bought milk."
Complex: "When I went to the store, I bought milk."

Simple: "The job is good. The location is far."
Complex: "Although the job is excellent, the location is quite far."

**Part B: Fluency Builders (4 minutes)**
Practice transition phrases:
- "On one hand... on the other hand..."
- "What I mean is..."
- "Let me put it this way..."
- "The main point is..."

**Part C: Pronunciation Focus (4 minutes)**
Quick drill on common CELPIP pronunciation challenges:
- Word stress: INcrease (noun) vs. inCREASE (verb)
- Sentence stress: "I THINK she should GO" (emphasis practice)
- Linking sounds: "an interesting opportunity"

### Activity 4: Task Fulfillment Theater (13 minutes)

**Setup:** Students draw task cards and must demonstrate appropriate tone/register

**Sample Task Cards:**

*Card 1:* "Call your boss to explain why you'll be late for an important meeting"
- Key: Formal, apologetic, solution-focused

*Card 2:* "Convince your friend to try a new restaurant"
- Key: Enthusiastic, descriptive, persuasive

*Card 3:* "Describe a complicated device to someone who will buy it"
- Key: Clear, detailed, helpful

**Peer Assessment:** Other students evaluate if the tone matched the situation

## Part 3: Integrated Practice Session (10 minutes)

### "CELPIP Speaking Simulation"

**Task:** "Your colleague is stressed about an upcoming presentation. Give advice."

**Process:**
1. Students prepare for 30 seconds
2. Record 90-second responses on phones
3. Self-evaluate using criteria checklist
4. Partner feedback using "glow and grow" format

**Self-Evaluation Checklist:**
- Content/Coherence: Did I develop my ideas clearly?
- Vocabulary: Did I use varied and appropriate words?
- Listenability: Was I fluent and grammatically accurate?
- Task Fulfillment: Did I sound like a supportive colleague?
