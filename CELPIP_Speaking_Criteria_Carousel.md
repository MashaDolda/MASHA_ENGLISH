## Slide 2: Content/Coherence Criterion

### 🧠 CONTENT/COHERENCE
*How well you organize and develop your ideas*

**CLB 4 - Basic Level:**
"I think job overseas good. Money is more. But family here. Hard decision. Maybe go, maybe no."
❌ *Simple ideas, minimal development*

**CLB 6 - Developing Level:**
"Taking an overseas job has benefits and challenges. The salary would be higher, which helps financially. However, being away from family is difficult. She should consider video calls and visits."
✅ *Clear ideas with some development*

**CLB 9 - Effective Level:**
"This opportunity presents a classic career dilemma. While the financial benefits and professional growth are compelling, she should weigh the emotional cost of distance against long-term career advancement. I'd recommend creating a concrete plan for maintaining relationships while building her future."
🌟 *Complex ideas, well-developed with nuanced thinking*

## Slide 3: Vocabulary Criterion

### 📚 VOCABULARY
*Range and accuracy of word choice*

**CLB 4 - Basic Level:**
"The chair is nice. It is blue. It has place for cup. Very good chair for work."
❌ *Basic, repetitive vocabulary*

**CLB 6 - Developing Level:**
"This is an interesting ergonomic chair. It features a built-in reading light and a convenient cup holder. The curved design looks comfortable for long work sessions."
✅ *Good range, some specific terms*

**CLB 9 - Effective Level:**
"This innovative piece showcases cutting-edge ergonomic design. The integrated lighting system and streamlined aesthetic make it both functional and visually striking. It's a sophisticated addition that would complement any modern workspace."

## Slide 4: Listenability Criterion

### 👂 LISTENABILITY
*Grammar, fluency, pronunciation, and rhythm*

**CLB 4 - Basic Level:**

❌ *Basic grammar, frequent pauses, choppy rhythm*

**CLB 6 - Developing Level:**
"Yesterday I went to the grocery store and bought some essentials. Prices have really increased lately. I think the government should consider implementing policies to help with inflation."
✅ *Generally correct grammar, mostly fluent with minor hesitations*

**CLB 9 - Effective Level:**
"Yesterday's shopping trip really highlighted how inflation is affecting everyday consumers. The government might want to explore targeted relief measures, particularly for essential goods that impact working families most significantly."

## Slide 5: Task Fulfillment Criterion

❌ *Doesn't fully address the task, minimal adaptation*

**CLB 6 - Developing Level:**

✅ *Addresses the task appropriately, shows understanding*

**CLB 9 - Effective Level:**
"I can really empathize with this dilemma - it's never easy choosing between career advancement and personal relationships. Let me suggest a framework for making this decision: first, evaluate the specific growth opportunities this role offers that you couldn't get locally..."
🌟 *Fully engages with task, adapts tone perfectly, addresses all aspects*
